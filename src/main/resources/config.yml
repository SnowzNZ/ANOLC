Claims:
  Regions:
    MinSize: 500           # In square blocks (length x width).
    MaxSize: 10000
    MaxLWRatio: 4          # This determines the maximum ratio of the longest side to the shortest. Example 400 blocks x 100 blocks = 4. This prevents regions that are too long and narrow.
    PricePerBlock: 1.5     # Area x PricePerBlock = RegionCost
  Plots:
    PricePerBlock: 0.1     # Volume x PricePerBlock = PlotCost
    BaseCost: 500          # The lowest price for a plot no matter how small.
